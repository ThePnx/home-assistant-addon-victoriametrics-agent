configuration:
  remoteWrite.url:
    name: Remote Write URL
    description: Prometheus-compatible remote storage endpoint such as VictoriaMetrics, where to send the data to.

  promscrape.enabled:
    name: Enable Prometheus config file usage
  promscrape.config:
    name: The path to Prometheus config file
    description: The path can point either to local file or to http url. vmagent doesn't support some sections of Prometheus config file, so you may need either to delete these sections or to run vmagent with -promscrape.config.strictParse=false command-line flag. In this case vmagent ignores unsupported sections. See the list of unsupported sections - https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent.html#unsupported-prometheus-config-sections

  httpAuth.enabled:
    name: Enable HTTP authentication
  httpAuth.username:
    name: Username
    description: Username for HTTP server's Basic Auth. The authentication is disabled if empty. See also -httpAuth.password
  httpAuth.password:
    name: Password
    description: Password for HTTP server's Basic Auth. The authentication is disabled if -httpAuth.username is empty
  httpListenAddr.tcp:
    name: TCP address to listen for http connections
    description: Set this flag to empty value in order to disable listening on any port. This mode may be useful for running multiple vmagent instances on the same server. Note that /targets and /metrics pages aren't available if -httpListenAddr=''. See also -tls and -httpListenAddr.useProxyProtocol (default ":8429")
  httpListenAddr.useProxyProtocol:
    name: Use proxy protocol
    description: Whether to use proxy protocol for connections accepted at -httpListenAddr . See https://www.haproxy.org/download/1.8/doc/proxy-protocol.txt . With enabled proxy protocol http server cannot serve regular /metrics endpoint. Use -pushmetrics.url for metrics pushing

  tls.enabled:
    name:  Enable TLS
    description: Whether to enable TLS for incoming HTTP requests at -httpListenAddr (aka https). -tlsCertFile and -tlsKeyFile must be set if -tls is set
  tls.certFile:
    name:  Path to file with TLS certificate
    description: Prefer ECDSA certs instead of RSA certs as RSA certs are slower. The provided certificate file is automatically re-read every second, so it can be dynamically updated
  tls.keyFile:
    name: Path to file with TLS key
    description: The provided key file is automatically re-read every second, so it can be dynamically updated
  tls.minVersion:
    name: TLS version
    description: Optional minimum TLS version to use for incoming requests over HTTPS if -tls is set. Supported values - TLS10, TLS11, TLS12, TLS13
