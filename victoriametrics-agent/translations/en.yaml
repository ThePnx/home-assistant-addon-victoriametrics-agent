  promscrape.enabled:
    name: Enable Prometheus config file usage
  promscrape.config:
    name: The path to Prometheus config file
    description: The path can point either to local file or to http url. vmagent doesn't support some sections of Prometheus config file, so you may need either to delete these sections or to run vmagent with -promscrape.config.strictParse=false command-line flag. In this case vmagent ignores unsupported sections. See the list of unsupported sections - https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent.html#unsupported-prometheus-config-sections

  httpAuth.enabled:
    name: Enable HTTP authentication
  httpAuth.username:
    name: Username
    description: Username for HTTP server's Basic Auth. The authentication is disabled if empty. See also -httpAuth.password
  httpAuth.password:
    name: Password
    description: Password for HTTP server's Basic Auth. The authentication is disabled if -httpAuth.username is empty
  httpListenAddr.tcp:
    name: TCP address to listen for http connections
    description: Set this flag to empty value in order to disable listening on any port. This mode may be useful for running multiple vmagent instances on the same server. Note that /targets and /metrics pages aren't available if -httpListenAddr=''. See also -tls and -httpListenAddr.useProxyProtocol (default ":8429")
  httpListenAddr.useProxyProtocol:
    name: Use proxy protocol
    description: Whether to use proxy protocol for connections accepted at -httpListenAddr . See https://www.haproxy.org/download/1.8/doc/proxy-protocol.txt . With enabled proxy protocol http server cannot serve regular /metrics endpoint. Use -pushmetrics.url for metrics pushing

  tls.certFile:
    name:  Path to file with TLS certificate
    description: Prefer ECDSA certs instead of RSA certs as RSA certs are slower. The provided certificate file is automatically re-read every second, so it can be dynamically updated
  tls.keyFile:
    name: Path to file with TLS key
    description: The provided key file is automatically re-read every second, so it can be dynamically updated
  tls.minVersion:
